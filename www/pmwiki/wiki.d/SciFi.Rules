text=!! Power level%0a%0aThis is a X = 6 game, with 60 CP and 20 SP. Characters are still human (or alien...), but are truely exceptional if they choose to specialise and have enough points to be broadly competant if they take a range of abilities.%0a%0a!! Relevant Attributes%0a%0aUnless you're doing something strange like playing an unusual alien or designing power armour, the majority of the attributes listed in the main rulebook will be unavailable to you. Listed below are the attributes available to a normal, human, character.%0a%0aThey are listed as Name/Max Ranks/Notes - attributes with no max rank listed default to 6. Max rank limits are not hard and fast, but you'll need a really good excuse for a normal human to be breaking them.%0a%0a* Agents/6/This attribute buys agents loyal to your character personally: there is also a team pool of points that can be used to buy loyal Imperial agents%0a* Armour/1/With Reduction to half effect (5 Armour), costs 2pts%0a* Attack Combat Mastery/3%0a* Combat Technique/6/Some specific techniques might not be appropriate%0a* Defence Combat Mastery/3%0a* Divine Relationship/6/Represents simple luck%0a* Extra Attacks/3%0a* Extra Defences%0a* Gadgeteer/3%0a* Gadgets/6/Almost all characters should have at least one level of this for their personal gear - there is also a team pool of points to buy Imperial equipment (personal gear for Agents and Henchmen should be purchased from their points totals)%0a* Heightened Awareness/3%0a* Henchmen/6/See Agents%0a* Highly Skilled/No Max/Most characters will have several levels of this%0a* Item of Power/6/Used to purchase major equipment you have personal access to (power armour, experimental military equipment, etc) - note that there is a team pool of points for Imperial equipment%0a* Massive Damage/3/You'll need a good reason for anything above level 1 - a certain amount of dedication is needed to reach the sheer levels of destructiveness suggested by the higher ranks.%0a* Organisational Ties/10/Represents Imperial Rank (military or civil). Bought at 1pt/level as Imperial resources are so limited on the planet. Note that if no party members buy at least level 8 in this attribute, the Imperial delegation will be led by an NPC. Level 10 means that you are the Imperial Governor: the buck stops with you for the entire planet. Characters with Organisational Ties at rank 4 or above must take the Owned and Red Tape Defects at one point level to represent Imperial limitations on their actions (no supporting local political parties, reduced free speech about the Imperium, must justify use of lethal force, must spend time on bureaucracy, etc)%0a* Own a Big Mecha/6/See Item of Power, but for major vehicles (strike spacecraft, battlemechs). Standard vehicles (up to and including tanks and military jets) are available as gear, so this attribute represents something pretty special: you'll need to justify how and why your character has personal access to it (the Conditional Ownership defect is a good start).%0a* Servant/6/Available if you want one really kick butt companion: in general, don't bother - in a campaign of this power level Agents are cheaper and nearly as powerful (anything less than a level 6 Servant is less powerful than an Agent).%0a* Sixth Sense/3/Available but unusual - speak to the GM. In general would be limited to Area PMV 4 (100m diameter around character) and for senses that could be developed via training (danger, eavesdroppers, being tailed, etc)%0a* Special Attack/3/Very uncommon, but might represent a devastating martial arts technique or some such. If allowed will generally have heavy limitations, do no more than 20 damage and have to fit the style of the background (no ranged ki strikes, etc)%0a* Special Movement/6/Some specific types are inappropriate (Dimension Hop, I'm looking at you)%0a* Tough/3/Characters are pretty tough already - don't go overboard...%0a* Unique Attribute/?/You never know what the players are going to come up with...%0a* Wealth/6/Characters should have at least one level of wealth per 5 full levels of Organisational Ties to the Imperium (unless you can give a good reason for where else the salary is going!). Note that characters are solvent by default even without buying the Wealth attribute: level 1 is already pretty rich (£250k + annual income by modern standards) with level 3+ putting you in the millionaire annual income category. Levels above 3 cost only 1pt/level - you're already rich enough to buy anything on the planet that's available for sale, so further levels aren't much more than window dressing.%0a
